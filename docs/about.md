    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>The most recent wave of technology has been revolved around the concept of automation and improving quality of life. Neural networks and machine learning models have paved the pathway for such innovations and have allowed for smarter and more reliable applications. We decided to implement a machine learning model to the discontinued Myo Armband to bring back the product with a more modern application. The Myo Armband utilizes 8 channels to gather electromyography (EMG) signals from the mid-arm and transfers the data via Bluetooth. There have been many research papers performed around dissimilar gesture recognition from the Myo Armband, and more recently, experiments have attempted to implement a real-time feature to the product through neural networks. The novelty behind our own design is the inclusion of single-finger gestures in the gesture-recognition algorithm at a real-time rate. The goal of our design is to implement single-finger and whole-hand gesture recognition to demonstrate user expression within personal devices. Key features to fully demonstrate user expression include the ease of typing and basic click/pointer events such as the click of a cursor.</p>
