    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>Our goal is to create a multi-use application via EMG-sensors to simplify the process of everyday tasks. Imagine controlling your TV, projector, computer, or even mobile device simply by moving your hands! This is the aim of our project and through the recognition of gestures and movement, we look to accomplish this goal and set a new standard of innovation!<br><br>Goals of the Product:<br>1) Differentiate between a total of 8 EMG signals<br>2) Properly integrate machine learning algorithm, differentiation, and external output</p>

    <h1>Our Approach</h1>
    <p>In order to fulfill the aim of our project, we look to gather multiple EMG signals derived from the human hand and differentiate the multiple readings at real-time speeds. The implementation of machine learning algorithms will be vital in obtaining the results we desire. The consistency and workability of our initial model will then be rounded out through a series of tests and observations to create an improved final product.</p>
    
    <h1>Our Research</h1>
    <p>Surface electromyography signals (sEMG) can be monitored on many parts of the body, but for the purposes of our project, we will be focusing on the wrist area. In total, we aim to differentiate between the 8 sEMG signals that can be gathered from the wrist. The machine learning algorithm that will be mainly explored is the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in conjunction with wavelet packet transform (WPT) which have been observed to differentiate the most signals through EMG analysis.</p>
