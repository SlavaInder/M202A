    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>Our goal is to create a gesture recognition algorithm for purposes of interfacing sEMG sensors with personal devices and IoT. We believe that today the vast potential of EMG signal for providing convenient and natural way of device control is majorly overlooked. With our project we want to contribute to the field of human biosignals processing, which one day will set a new standrds of human-computer communication!
  
    <h1>Our Approach</h1>
    <p>In order to fulfill the aim of our project, we collected a dataset of EMG signals derived from the forearm during the process of typing. We trained a classifiction neural network to recognize pushes on different buttons on the keyboard, and implmented it within an android app. We successfully showed, that   
    
    gathered multiple EMG signals derived from the human hand and differentiate the multiple readings at real-time speeds. The implementation of machine learning algorithms will be vital in obtaining the results we desire. The consistency and workability of our initial model will then be rounded out through a series of tests and observations to create an improved final product.</p>
